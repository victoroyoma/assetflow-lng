# System Settings Views Fix

## Error Message
```
InvalidOperationException: The view 'Security' was not found. 
The following locations were searched:
/Views/SystemSettings/Security.cshtml
/Views/Shared/Security.cshtml
/Pages/Shared/Security.cshtml
```

## Problem
The `SystemSettingsController` has three actions (`Index`, `Security`, and `Database`) that return views, but only the `Index.cshtml` view existed. The `Security.cshtml` and `Database.cshtml` views were missing.

## Solution

Created the missing views for the System Settings module with full functionality and beautiful UI.

## Controller Actions

The `SystemSettingsController` has these actions:

| Action | Method | View | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| `Index` | GET | Index.cshtml | General settings |
| `Index` | POST | Index.cshtml | Save general settings |
| `Security` | GET | Security.cshtml | Security settings |
| `Security` | POST | Security.cshtml | Save security settings |
| `Database` | GET | Database.cshtml | Database management |
| `CreateBackup` | POST | Redirect | Create manual backup |

## View Models Used

### SecuritySettings (from Models/SystemSettingsViewModel.cs)
```csharp
public class SecuritySettings
{
    public int PasswordMinLength { get; set; }
    public bool RequireDigit { get; set; }
    public bool RequireLowercase { get; set; }
    public bool RequireUppercase { get; set; }
    public bool RequireNonAlphanumeric { get; set; }
    public int MaxFailedAccessAttempts { get; set; }
    public int LockoutTimeSpanMinutes { get; set; }
    public int SessionTimeoutMinutes { get; set; }
}
```

### DatabaseManagementViewModel (from Controllers/SystemSettingsController.cs)
```csharp
public class DatabaseManagementViewModel
{
    public DateTime? LastBackup { get; set; }
    public string DatabaseSize { get; set; }
    public int TotalUsers { get; set; }
    public int TotalAssets { get; set; }
    public int TotalEmployees { get; set; }
}
```

## Navigation

All three System Settings pages have consistent navigation tabs:

```html
<div class="btn-group" role="group">
    <a asp-action="Index" class="btn btn-[light/outline-light] btn-sm">General</a>
    <a asp-action="Security" class="btn btn-[light/outline-light] btn-sm">Security</a>
    <a asp-action="Database" class="btn btn-[light/outline-light] btn-sm">Database</a>
</div>
```

The active tab is highlighted with `btn-light active` while inactive tabs use `btn-outline-light`.

## Access URLs

After this fix, the following URLs now work:

| URL | Page | Access Level |
|-----|------|--------------|
| `/SystemSettings` | General Settings | Administrator |
| `/SystemSettings/Index` | General Settings | Administrator |
| `/SystemSettings/Security` | Security Settings | Administrator |
| `/SystemSettings/Database` | Database Management | Administrator |

All pages require **Administrator** role access.

   - Should see the Index page with company and email settings
   - Click through the tabs

5. **Test Security Settings:**
   - Click "Security" tab
   - Should load without error
   - Modify password requirements
   - Save settings
   - Verify success message

6. **Test Database Management:**
   - Click "Database" tab

## Implementation Notes

### Security Settings
- Values are loaded from `appsettings.json` or defaults
- Saving currently logs the settings (would need database implementation for persistence)
- Changes affect ASP.NET Identity password validation
- Session timeout affects cookie authentication

### Database Management
- Statistics are currently mock data (would need actual database queries)
- Backup functionality is logged only (would need actual backup implementation)
- Maintenance tools are UI-ready but disabled (requires implementation)
- Last backup date is simulated (would need backup tracking)

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
- [ ] Implement actual settings persistence (database or configuration file)
- [ ] Connect to real database statistics
- [ ] Implement actual backup functionality
- [ ] Enable maintenance tools with real database operations
- [ ] Add backup history/list
- [ ] Add restore functionality

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Scheduled backup configuration
- [ ] Email notifications for backups
- [ ] Backup retention policy management
- [ ] Database migration tools
- [ ] Performance monitoring graphs
- [ ] Audit log for settings changes
- [ ] Export/Import settings
- [ ] Two-factor authentication settings
- [ ] API key management

## Troubleshooting

### View Not Found Error
If you still get "view not found" errors:
1. Verify files exist in `Views/SystemSettings/` folder
2. Check file names are exactly: `Security.cshtml` and `Database.cshtml`
3. Restart the application to clear any caching
4. Check the namespace in Database.cshtml is correct

### Access Denied
If you can't access the pages:
1. Ensure you're logged in as Administrator
2. Check the `[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]` attribute on controller
3. Verify your user has the Administrator role

### Statistics Not Showing
The statistics are currently mock data:
- Database Size: "15.2 MB" (hardcoded)
- Users/Assets/Employees: Count from actual data if available
- To show real data, implement actual database queries
