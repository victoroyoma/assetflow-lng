# Jobs Module Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the system to support both **Imaging Jobs** and **Maintenance Jobs** under a unified "Jobs" module. The maintenance card on the dashboard now creates a maintenance job instead of navigating to a separate page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Changes

#### New Enum: `JobType`
**File**: `Data/Enums/JobType.cs`
```csharp
public enum JobType
{
    Imaging = 1,
    Maintenance = 2
}
```

#### Updated Entity: `ImagingJob`
**File**: `Data/ImagingJob.cs`
- Added `[Table("Jobs")]` attribute to rename database table
- Added `JobType` property (required, default: Imaging)
- Changed `ImagingType` to nullable (not needed for maintenance jobs)
- Updated `JobDescription` computed property to handle both job types
- Updated XML documentation

**Key Changes**:
```csharp
[Required]
[Display(Name = "Job Type")]
public JobType JobType { get; set; } = JobType.Imaging;

[Display(Name = "Imaging Type")]
public ImagingType? ImagingType { get; set; }  // Now nullable

public string JobDescription => JobType == JobType.Maintenance 
    ? $"Maintenance - {Asset?.AssetTag ?? "Unknown Asset"}"
    : $"{ImagingType?.ToString() ?? "Imaging"} - {Asset?.AssetTag ?? "Unknown Asset"}";
```

### 2. Database Changes

#### Migration: `AddJobTypeToJobs`
- Added `JobType` column to ImagingJobs table (renamed to Jobs via [Table] attribute)
- Added indexes for `JobType` and `{JobType, Status}` for query performance
- Updated seed data: Job #7 changed from imaging to maintenance job

**Command Used**:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddJobTypeToJobs
dotnet ef database update
```

#### Updated ApplicationDbContext
**File**: `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
- Added `JobType` index
- Added composite index for `{JobType, Status}`
- Updated seed data to include JobType values
- Changed Job ID 7 to be a maintenance job example

### 3. User Interface Changes

#### Navigation Menu
**File**: `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
- Renamed "Imaging Jobs" to "Jobs"
- Changed menu ID from `imagingSubmenu` to `jobsSubmenu`
- Updated icon from compact-disc to tasks
- Kept all sub-menu links intact

#### Dashboard
**File**: `Pages/Index.cshtml`
- **Maintenance Card**: Now links to `/Imaging/Create?jobType=Maintenance` instead of `/Assets/Maintenance`
- **Quick Actions**: Split imaging card into two:
  - "Schedule Imaging" → `/Imaging/Create?jobType=Imaging`
  - "Maintenance Job" → `/Imaging/Create?jobType=Maintenance`
- **Jobs Section**: 
  - Renamed "Imaging Jobs" header to "Jobs"
  - Fixed link from `/ImagingJobs/Index` to `/Imaging/Index`

#### Create Job Page
**File**: `Pages/Imaging/Create.cshtml`
- Dynamic title based on `JobType` query parameter
- Conditional rendering of imaging-specific fields:
  - **Imaging Type** field (only for imaging jobs)
  - **Image Version** field (only for imaging jobs)
- Different header colors:
  - Imaging: Blue (primary)
  - Maintenance: Yellow (warning)
- Different icons:
  - Imaging: fa-desktop
  - Maintenance: fa-tools
- Hidden field for `JobType` to preserve selection

**File**: `Pages/Imaging/Create.cshtml.cs`
- Added `JobType` query parameter property
- Updated `OnGetAsync` to set job type from query string
- Modified job creation to:
  - Include `JobType` field
  - Set `ImagingType` to null for maintenance jobs
  - Display appropriate success message based on job type
- Updated model class `ImagingJobCreateModel`:
  - Added `JobType` property (required)
  - Changed `ImagingType` to nullable

#### Index Page
**File**: `Pages/Imaging/Index.cshtml`
- Changed title from "Imaging Jobs" to "Jobs Management"
- Updated subtitle to mention both imaging and maintenance jobs
- Split "Create New Job" button into two:
  - "New Imaging Job" (green, compact-disc icon)
  - "New Maintenance Job" (yellow, tools icon)
- Changed main icon from compact-disc to tasks

### 4. Features Implemented

✅ **Unified Job System**
- Single table/entity handles both imaging and maintenance jobs
- JobType enum distinguishes between job types
- Conditional fields based on job type

✅ **Dashboard Integration**
- Maintenance card creates a maintenance job
- Quick actions show both job type creation options
- Jobs section shows all job types

✅ **Create Job Flow**
- Dynamic form that shows/hides fields based on job type
- URL parameter determines job type
- Appropriate validation for each job type
- Visual differentiation (colors, icons) between job types

✅ **Search & Filter Capabilities**
- Existing asset search functionality works for both job types
- Jobs index shows all jobs (imaging and maintenance)
- Status filtering applies to both job types

### 5. Assets Under Maintenance

Assets with an active Maintenance job will:
- Show in the Jobs index filtered by JobType = Maintenance
- Display in the job queue with maintenance-specific styling
- Be searchable from the Jobs module
- Have their status trackable through job status (Pending → In Progress → Completed)

**To view all assets under maintenance**:
1. Go to Jobs → All Jobs (sidebar or dashboard)
2. Filter by Status = "In Progress" and JobType = Maintenance
3. Or use the asset search to find specific assets

### 6. Migration Path

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Class name `ImagingJob` preserved (no breaking changes to existing code)
- Database table renamed via `[Table("Jobs")]` attribute
- All existing imaging jobs automatically set to `JobType.Imaging`
- Existing relationships and navigation properties unchanged

**Data Migration**:
- All existing jobs default to `JobType.Imaging`
- Seed data updated with one maintenance job example
- No data loss during migration

### 7. Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Imaging Job**: 
   - Click "New Imaging Job" from dashboard
   - Verify Imaging Type and Image Version fields are shown
   - Create job and verify JobType = Imaging in database

2. **Create Maintenance Job**:
   - Click "Maintenance Job" from dashboard quick actions
   - Verify Imaging Type and Image Version fields are hidden
   - Create job and verify JobType = Maintenance in database

3. **View All Jobs**:
   - Navigate to Jobs → All Jobs
   - Verify both imaging and maintenance jobs are listed
   - Check that job descriptions show correctly

4. **Asset Search**:
   - From Jobs module, search for assets
   - Verify assets appear regardless of job type

5. **Job Queue**:
   - Verify both job types appear in queue
   - Check status updates work for both types

## Database Schema Impact

**Before**:
```
ImagingJobs table:
- Id
- AssetId
- TechnicianId
- ImagingType (required)
- ImageVersion
- Status
- ... other fields
```

**After**:
```
Jobs table (renamed via attribute):
- Id
- AssetId  
- TechnicianId
- JobType (required, new)
- ImagingType (nullable, updated)
- ImageVersion
- Status
- ... other fields

Indexes:
- JobType
- (JobType, Status) composite
```

## Files Modified

### Data Layer
- ✅ `Data/Enums/JobType.cs` (new)
- ✅ `Data/ImagingJob.cs`
- ✅ `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
- ✅ `Migrations/[timestamp]_AddJobTypeToJobs.cs` (new)

### Pages
- ✅ `Pages/Index.cshtml`
- ✅ `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
- ✅ `Pages/Imaging/Index.cshtml`
- ✅ `Pages/Imaging/Create.cshtml`
- ✅ `Pages/Imaging/Create.cshtml.cs`

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - 8 warnings (pre-existing, not related to changes)

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **Add JobType Filter** to Index page dropdown
2. **Update Details Page** to show job type badge
3. **Add Statistics** for maintenance jobs on dashboard
4. **Create Maintenance-Specific Fields** (e.g., maintenance type, parts used)
5. **Add Bulk Operations** for maintenance jobs
6. **Email Notifications** differentiated by job type
7. **Reports** showing maintenance vs imaging job metrics

## Summary

The system now supports both Imaging and Maintenance jobs under a unified "Jobs" module. Users can:
- Create maintenance jobs directly from the dashboard
- View all assets under maintenance in the Jobs module
- Search for any asset from the Jobs interface
- Track maintenance job status alongside imaging jobs
- Use the same workflow for both job types with appropriate field visibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding new functionality without requiring major refactoring of existing code.
