## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Storage**: Local file system (`wwwroot/uploads/`) with GUID-prefixed filenames
- **Upload Pattern**: AJAX/Fetch API for responsive UI without page reloads
- **QR Library**: 
  - Backend: QRCoder (NuGet)
  - Frontend: html5-qrcode (CDN v2.3.8)
- **Security**: 
  - All endpoints require `[Authorize]`
  - Delete operations protected by policies
  - File type whitelist validation

### API Endpoints Implemented

**Attachments** (8 endpoints):
```
POST   /api/attachments/job/{jobId}
POST   /api/attachments/asset/{assetId}
GET    /api/attachments/job/{jobId}
GET    /api/attachments/asset/{assetId}
GET    /api/attachments/download/job/{attachmentId}
GET    /api/attachments/download/asset/{attachmentId}
DELETE /api/attachments/job/{attachmentId}
DELETE /api/attachments/asset/{attachmentId}
```

**QR Codes** (4 endpoints):
```
GET  /api/qrcode/asset/{assetId}/generate
GET  /api/qrcode/asset/{assetId}/generate-url
GET  /api/qrcode/asset/{assetId}/base64
POST /api/qrcode/lookup
```
